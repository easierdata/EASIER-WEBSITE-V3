    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this blog post, we will introduce you to a decentralized peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol called IPFS, which can revolutionize how you handle large datasets, such as satellite imagery, for tasks like object detection and land cover classification. With its content-addressing and decentralized architecture, IPFS makes it easier to share and distribute data across a network of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this post, we will be showcasing IPFS through the classic and timeless Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis of Landsat 9 imagery. This example is an excellent illustration of how IPFS can be used to handle geospatial data, from fetching imagery to publishing a geospatial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, whether you're a seasoned geospatial professional or just starting, this blog post is perfect for you. Get ready to revolutionize your geospatial analyses with IPFS!"

    "## What is IPFS?\n",
    "IPFS, or InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer network protocol designed to create a decentralized and distributed web. It allows users to store and access content in a content-addressed manner, which means that the address of the content is derived from the content itself, rather than relying on a centralized server. This makes IPFS highly resilient to censorship, data loss, and other forms of centralization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, IPFS is a peer-to-peer network, meaning that data is stored and shared across multiple nodes in the network. When you query the IPFS network for a piece of content, the network returns the content from the node that is closest to you¹, resulting in faster data access and reduced load on any single node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will not only explore how to use IPFS to fetch Landsat imagery and publish a geospatial analysis, but we'll also be setting up our own IPFS node. This allows our computer to fetch from IPFS and, if you choose, participate in the network to make the data more available for everyone."

By leveraging IPFS in place of traditional storage systems, we can benefit from content-addressing and decentralization. These features lead to faster data access, improved data persistence, and more efficient storage, highlighting the potential of IPFS in geospatial workflows."

This will allow others to fetch the data from your IPFS node, which will improve the availability of the data. After pinning the data to our local IPFS node, we can fetch it from any IPFS node worldwide using the same commands as before. However, keep in mind that download speeds will be influenced by the distance between your computer and the requester's location, as well as the internet connection speeds for both parties.\n",
