# State of the Ecosystem - A closer look at the decentralized geospatial web

As part of our ongoing efforts under [The Decentralized Geospatial Collaborative](https://decentralizedgeo.org/), we've started to define the ecosystem for decentralized geospatial tooling.  We've also been fostering a community on the Astral Telegram channel, with discussions on expanding the possibilities of decentralization within the digital geospatial realm. In this post, we take a closer look at the core applications and tools that form the backbone of this ecosystem, each playing a critical role in enabling decentralized geospatial capabilities.

## Core Components of the Decentralized Geospatial Ecosystem

These applications and protocols are redefining how geospatial data is stored, shared, and verified in a decentralized and trust-minimized manner.

### **1. STAC Ecosystem: Discover geospatial content on decentralized networks**

The **[STAC Ecosystem](https://stacspec.org/en)** enables us to discover geospatial content stored on decentralized networks. By leveraging the interoperability of SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification, we can extend the metadata that describes each collection of data with tags like [content identifiers](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) (CIDs) for retrieving content from IPFS and a [Filecoin Piece](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_files/piece/) CID to identify storage providers on the Filecoin network that are storing the file.

- **Capabilities:**
  - Provides a standardized way to describe geospatial assets and collections.
  - Enables decentralized discovery of geospatial content.
  - Enhances interoperability between geospatial tools and decentralized storage solutions.
- **How it fits in:**
  - Acts as a bridge between traditional geospatial workflows and decentralized storage solutions.
  - Facilitates the creation of decentralized geospatial applications that leverage IPFS and Filecoin.

### **2. IPFS-STAC: Decentralized retrieval of geospatial content**

The **IPFS-STAC** library provides an interface between geospatial datasets and decentralized storage solutions like IPFS and Filecoin. Built as a Python client, it enables users to manage and retrieve geospatial assets in a decentralized way, ensuring data persistence and integrity without reliance on centralized servers.

- **Capabilities:**
  - Stores and retrieves geospatial metadata and assets using IPFS and Filecoin.
  - Supports the **STAC (Spatiotemporal Asset Catalog) specification**, making it interoperable with existing geospatial tools.
  - Enhances data availability for decentralized applications needing reliable geospatial data sources.

- **How it fits in:**
  - This tool bridges the gap between Web3 storage solutions and traditional GIS workflows.
  - It allows researchers, developers, and institutions to securely share and retrieve geospatial datasets without a central authority.

### **3. Web3 Geo-Dashboard: A unified interface for visualizing decentralized geospatial data**

The motivation behind this project is to showcase how decentralized technology such as IPFS and Filecoin can cultivate an open ecosystem for data exploration and management.

provides a user-friendly interface to interact with decentralized geospatial datasets. It enables users to visualize, query, and interact with blockchain-based geospatial data.

- **Capabilities:**
  - Visually explore geospatial datasets that contain metadata of content enriched STAC API.
  - Provides tools for querying and interacting with proof-of-location data.
  - Supports integration with blockchain-based geospatial applications.

- **How it fits in:**
  - Acts as a central access point for decentralized geospatial applications.
  - Allows users and developers to explore and verify geospatial claims and metadata stored on decentralized networks.

### **4. Astral API: A gateway for decentralized Proof-of-Location**

The **Astral API** serves as a **unified access point** for decentralized location proofs. By aggregating and standardizing proof-of-location attestations across multiple blockchains and storage solutions, it simplifies the development of Web3 geospatial applications.

- **Capabilities:**
  - Provides a standard API for querying proof-of-location data.
  - Enables interoperability between different decentralized geospatial systems.
  - Supports multi-blockchain verification mechanisms.

- **How it fits in:**
  - Acts as the core infrastructure layer for decentralized proof-of-location applications.
  - Enables developers to easily integrate location verification into their Web3 applications.

### **5. Decentralized Location Logger: Secure and verifiable geospatial logging**

The **Decentralized Location Logger** enables users to record and verify location data using blockchain and decentralized storage. This tool is particularly useful for creating **tamper-proof** geospatial records, essential for use cases such as environmental monitoring, supply chain tracking, and disaster response.

- **Capabilities:**
  - Allows users to log location data with cryptographic attestations.
  - Stores data on decentralized networks like IPFS/Filecoin for enhanced availability and security.
  - Supports verifiable timestamps and proof-of-existence mechanisms.

- **How it fits in:**
  - Provides an open and censorship-resistant way to track and verify geospatial events.
  - Enables individuals and organizations to create immutable location-based records.

## The Broader Ecosystem

The success of the decentralized geospatial ecosystem is driven by the contributions of developers, researchers, and community members who are exploring new ways to leverage these tools. Here's a few of community-led initiatives and projects that are pushing the boundaries of decentralized geospatial technologies:

> Groups of interest: Devonian (Alan), dClimate, Proximum and ProofMode

## The Road Ahead

The decentralized geospatial web is still evolving, and these tools represent just the beginning of whatâ€™s possible. With continued innovation, we anticipate:

- Defining and implementing OGC standards.
- Greater adoption of proof-of-location frameworks.
- Integration with emerging Web3 technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving location verification.
- Extending the ecosystem with new tools and applications that leverage decentralized geospatial data.
