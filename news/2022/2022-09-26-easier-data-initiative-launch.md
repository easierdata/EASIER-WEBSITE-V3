We are thrilled to announce the EASIER Data Initiative, a [@umdgeography](https://twitter.com/umdgeography), and [@FFDWeb](https://twitter.com/FFDWeb) collaboration. We make it easier to upload and retrieve geospatial data from decentralized storage systems including [#Filecoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Filecoin?src=hashtag_click) and [#IPFS](https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPFS?src=hashtag_click).  
  
Check out [FFDW's official blog post](https://ffdweb.org/ffdw-and-easier-data-initiative-collaborate-to-upload-spatial-data-to-filecoin-network/) about it!
